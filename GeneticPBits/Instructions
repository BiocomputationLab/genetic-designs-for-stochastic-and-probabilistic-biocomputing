Instructions to run the NOT (or AND) gate simulation:

Download the pbits_OR_gate.f90 (or pbits_AND_gate.f90) file.
Compile the file using a Fortran compiler, such as gfortran.
Run the executable file created after compilation.
Data files will be generated in the same folder where the executable is run. (Examples of data files can be found in the datafile folder.)
